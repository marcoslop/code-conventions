### Change code whenever you see that can be improved

Don´t be shy, if you find something that you don´t like and could be programmed in a clearer way, do it.

One of the best moments to refactor or improve code is when you are trying to understand it. If you find that some lines of code could be extracted to a new method, do it.

Don´t be worried because the other programmer will be annoyed because you have changed his "masterpiece of code". If you haven´t understood the code well is because it´s not as good :-)

If you perform a minor refactor as extracting a new method, or you are removing 8 parameters of a method and grouping them into a Object, there should be no problem in changing it. If you are performing a greater change, maybe you should ask first the owner/s of this code.

Whenever you change anything, check first if tests exists, if not you should create tests first and then perform the change.
